# Resources for Study

## Project Ideas
Build a interpreter/compiler and create a simple programming language from scratch
* [Crafting Interpreters - A handbook for making programming languages • Bob Nystrom](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com)
* [The Lambda Calculus for Absolute Dummies (like myself) • palmström](http://palmstroem.blogspot.jp/2012/05/lambda-calculus-for-absolute-dummies.html?m=1)
* [COMPUTATION STARTING FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES (DRAFT) • Jan Wedekind](http://www.wedesoft.de/binary-lambda-calculus.html)
* [The memory models that underlie programming languages • canonical.org](http://canonical.org/~kragen/memory-models/)
* [Dragon taming with Tailbiter, a bytecode compiler for Python • codewords.recurse.com](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/seven/dragon-taming-with-tailbiter-a-bytecode-compiler)

Dive into advanced functional programming concepts with Haskell
* TODO: select RC Wiki Haskell resources

Try (functional) reactive programming with RxSwift and/or React.js

Get back into JavaScript (and possibly TypeScript) and see what’s state of the art for web development (looking at React, Relay, GraphQL, Jest, etc.)

Get an introduction into basic devops and set up CI and some more complex toolchains and production environments with Docker, AWS, and whatever else is recommended

Pair with people who can help me become more productive as a programmer and get better at test-driven development

Explore data visualization, procedural generation, and generative art — I want to try d3.[js|express] and graphics programming with Metal or Vulcan
* Information Visualization
    - [Information Visualization • Enrico Bertini](http://enrico.bertini.io/teaching/)
* Graphics Programming
    - [The lost art of 3D rendering without shaders](http://machinethink.net/blog/3d-rendering-without-shaders/)
* TODO: Add resources from note "DataViz & Generative Art"

Learn more about decentralized, peer-to-peer technologies; I'm interested in blockchain, but not necessarily for financial use cases
* [Blockchain 101 - A Visual Demo • YouTube](https://youtu.be/Cc3bdKNYlEM)
* [The DCS Triangle](https://blog.bigchaindb.com/the-dcs-triangle-5ce0e9e0f1dc)

Experiment with sharing my work in progress — maybe finally blog on a regular basis

Interesting open-source projects

## Meta
A recipe for learning better:
1. Get to the point. What do I get from learning the material? Compact lessons, broken up in bite-sized pieces.
2. Have a natural order. Material is taught in an order that supports learning. Can be chronological, is usually gradually increasing complexity and difficulty.
3. Use analogies and visualizations. Avoid abstract concepts and turn them into concrete examples.
4. Make it fun. Avoid top-down lecturing, have a relaxed conversation between peers.

Complexity in software development
* [Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs](http://worrydream.com/refs/Backus-CanProgrammingBeLiberated.pdf)
* TODO: Add resources from note "Reducing Complexity"
