# Study Resources
_My big dumping ground for links to articles, (e)books, videos and similar material that caught my attention, but I haven't had the time to look at yet. I'm still figuring out how to work with this list…_

## Meta

### A recipe for learning better
1. Get to the point. What do I get from learning the material? Compact lessons, broken up in bite-sized pieces.
2. Have a natural order. Material is taught in an order that supports learning. Can be chronological, is usually gradually increasing complexity and difficulty.
3. Use analogies and visualizations. Avoid abstract concepts and turn them into concrete examples.
4. Make it fun. Avoid top-down lecturing, have a relaxed conversation between peers.

    - In software engineering we claim to have figured out many things, but don't back them up with data and research. In many cases we still don't know what's objectively better, and fall victim to statements that sound clever to us, and confirm our own biases. For real progress in our field we need higher standards for proof.
