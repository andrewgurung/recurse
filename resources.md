## Meta

### A recipe for learning better
1. Get to the point. What do I get from learning the material? Compact lessons, broken up in bite-sized pieces.
2. Have a natural order. Material is taught in an order that supports learning. Can be chronological, is usually gradually increasing complexity and difficulty.
3. Use analogies and visualizations. Avoid abstract concepts and turn them into concrete examples.
4. Make it fun. Avoid top-down lecturing, have a relaxed conversation between peers.
