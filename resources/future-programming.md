# Future of Programming
*One of the main areas of focus for me, long before coming to RC and likely long after I will have left, is thinking about how programming should and will change in the future. Realizing that there is still more to explore, Iâ€™m moving all related resources to this separate document.*

### Criticisms of the Status Quo
[ðŸ“º 10m â€¢ SICP / What is "Computer Science"?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zQLUPjefuWA)

[Systems Past: the only 8 software innovations we actually use](https://davidad.github.io/blog/2014/03/12/the-operating-system-is-out-of-date/)<br>
Criticizes the lack of innovation in programming and explains that the biggest innovations in the field, like programming languages, operating systems, interactivity, and the Internet have been invented between 1955 and 1970.

[No Silver Bullet â€” Essence and Accident in Software Engineering](http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelated/no-silver-bullet.pdf) â€¢ F. Brooks, 1986<br>
Divides complexities in software engineering into essential and accidential complexities and argues that all past and most promising future breakthroughs are solving accidential difficulties, not essential ones. The author sees the promising attacks on the conceptual essence in software/library reuse, rapid prototyping, incremental development, and great design.

[The Unofficial Guide to Rich Hickey's Brain](http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/programming/the-unofficial-guide-to-rich-hickeys-brain/) â€¢ Daniel Higginbotham, December 2012<br>
Contrasts Object-Oriented Programming with Functional Programming and explains the "fundamental flaws' of accidential complexity in OOP that FP allows us to deal with in a better way. Includes a brilliant metaphor about the meta-physics of OOP and FP where in OOP the river is modeled as an object with changing state, while in FP the river is an abstract concepts that emerges from a process generating a succession of related atomic, unchangable entities (atoms).

[ðŸ“º 1h â€¢ Greg Wilson - What We Actually Know About Software Development, and Why We Believe Itâ€™s True](https://vimeo.com/9270320)<br>
In software engineering we claim to have figured out many things, but don't back them up with data and research. In many cases we still don't know what's objectively better, and fall victim to statements that sound clever to us, and confirm our own biases. For real progress in our field we need higher standards for proof.

[Toward a frozen operating system](https://urbit.org/blog/2017.5-frozen/)<br>
Is it possible to build system software or OS level software than never has to be updated?

### Complexity in software development
[Complexity and Strategy](https://hackernoon.com/complexity-and-strategy-325cd7f59a92)

[ðŸ“º Hearts and Minds â€¢ GDC Vault](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1020788/Hearts-and)

### Future of Programming Languages
ðŸ“• Mindstorms - Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas<br>
Focuses on education, but highlights the importance of how a programming language (like LOGO, which was created by the author and is used in the book) can be designed in a way such that learners can use the language to explore concepts in a simple, simulated environment that would be difficult to explore without a computer.

[Programming Paradigms for Dummies: What Every Programmer Should Know](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf)<br>
Extensive overview over different programming paradigms and how they are related to each other, as well as which programming languages are good examples for each paradigm. Contains a section about how a "definitive programming language" needs to be designed.

[The Hundred-Year Language](http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html)<br>
Abstract thoughts about what programming languages look like in 100 years from now.

[Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html)<br>
A humorous criticism of the Java Programming Language and how it is too focused on objects everywhere, while other languages allow functions to be as important (or even more important) than objects / data strutures.

[Graal &Â Truffle](https://blog.plan99.net/graal-truffle-134d8f28fb69%3E)<br>
Research project to use Futamura projections to create new programming languages quicker which integrate into existing languages and platforms and still perform well.

[The Three Projections of Doctor Futamura](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/05/three-projections-of-doctor-futamura.html)<br>
Explains the concept of abstracting over interpreters and compilers and generate specializers that emit interpreters and compilers.

### Visions for the Future
[ðŸ’¡ The future of software, the end of apps, and why UX designers should care about type theory](https://pchiusano.github.io/2013-05-22/future-of-software.html) â€¢ <br>
Paints an interesting picture of a world where composing components is much simpler and instead of apps that have been put together by developers, regular users are able to compose service components to do what they want them to do.

We're stuck with simulating old media with our new media and don't take advantage of all the capabilities new media offers.
