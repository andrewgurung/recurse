# Future of Programming
*One of the main areas of focus for me, long before coming to RC and likely long after I will have left, is thinking about how programming should and will change in the future. Realizing that there is still more to explore, Iâ€™m moving all related resources to this separate document.*

## Reading List
I have not yet looked at these articles.

	\<br\>In software engineering we claim to have figured out many things, but don't back them up with data and research. In many cases we still don't know what's objectively better, and fall victim to statements that sound clever to us, and confirm our own biases. For real progress in our field we need higher standards for proof.
* [x]() [Toward a frozen operating system][32]
	\<br\>Is it possible to build system software or OS level software than never has to be updated?

* [x]() [Graal &Â Truffle][42]
	\<br\>Research project to use Futamura projections to create new programming languages quicker which integrate into existing languages and platforms and still perform well.
* [x]() [The Three Projections of Doctor Futamura][44]
	\<br\>Explains the concept of abstracting over interpreters and compilers and generate specializers that emit interpreters and compilers.

### Research Projects and Groups
* [Viewpoints Research Institute][45]
* [Human Advancement Research Community][46]

### Visions for the Future
* [x]() [ðŸ’¡ The future of software, the end of apps, and why UX designers should care about type theory][48] â€¢ 
	\<br\>Paints an interesting picture of a world where composing components is much simpler and instead of apps that have been put together by developers, regular users are able to compose service components to do what they want them to do.
